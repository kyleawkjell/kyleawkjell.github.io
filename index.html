            <p>Hello! This is a little bit about me, nothing special just the facts.</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in a small town out in the oil fields of West Texas. Growing up I always had dreams of moving to the big city...Lubbock! (not a big city but back then it really felt like it!) Eventually we did move there as a family in 2005, and I grew to appreciate and cherish the fact I could call that my hometown. I ended up staying there for college as well, attending Texas Tech University and majoring in Electrical Engineering.</p>
            <p>During college I met the love of my live, Maegan. She was just visiting a friend over the summer, and when that summer ended I packed up my things and moved to San Antonio to be closer to her. I worked for a while with a Japanese engineering company, Shimadzu. This opened up the opportunity for me to relocate to Dallas, which just so happened to be my soon to be wife's hometown (how lucky!). Shortly after moving there, we moved in together and the rest is, as they say, history.</p>
            <p>Working in Dallas was a humbling experience, and one that I am greatful for. The difficulties of traveling constantly and the stress of big city life showed me how much I truly did not enjoy my career in engineering.</p>
            <p>I've recently moved to Denver with my wife and our 4 pets! We have 3 dogs and a cat: Kaia, Josie, Tucker, and Princeton. Coming from Dallas was a huge adjustment for us (mainly the actually having a winter part) but we love it hear and just bought a house so we can settle down.</p>
            <p>I am currently a Technical Director for the Barcelona Elite Soccer Academy here in Denver, and seriously love what I do. As you can see I have a boys team ages 6 & 7, but I also coach a girls team ages 11 & 12. Along with that I run some of our additional programs and help the club by recruiting new players at all times. It is quite a demanding job but I personally can't think of anything more rewarding.</p>
